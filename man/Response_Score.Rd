\title{Compute response enrichment score for each analysis unit}
\usage{
Response_Score(mat, topN = 1500, nGenes = 10000, cancer)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A numeric expression matrix,
with genes as rows and analysis units as columns.}

\item{topN}{Integer. Number of top-ranked genes used to compute
the cumulative enrichment score. Default is 3000.}

\item{nGenes}{Integer. Total number of detected genes used for
position weighting. Default is 10000.}

\item{cancer}{Character string specifying cancer type.
Must be one of the supported cancer codes
("NSCLC","MEL","HCC","BLCA","RCC","BC","GC","ESCA","HNSC","GBM","CRC").}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of normalized enrichment scores,
named by analysis unit IDs.
}
\description{
This function calculates a normalized enrichment score
(AUC-like score) for each analysis unit based on ranked gene
expression and pre-trained gene differential weights
for a given cancer type.
