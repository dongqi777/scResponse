\title{Plot enrichment score curve for a single analysis unit}
\usage{
Plot_EnrichmentScore(mat, cell_id, cancer, topN = 1500, nGenes = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A numeric expression matrix,
with genes as rows and analysis units as columns.}

\item{cell_id}{Character string specifying the target analysis unit ID
(must match a column name in \code{mat}).}

\item{cancer}{Character string specifying cancer type used to
load pre-trained gene differential weights.
Cancer type must be one of the supported cancer codes
("NSCLC","MEL","HCC","BLCA","RCC","BC","GC","ESCA","HNSC","GBM","CRC").}

\item{topN}{Integer. Number of top-ranked genes used to build
the enrichment curve. Default is 3000.}

\item{nGenes}{Integer. Total number of detected genes used for
position weighting. Default is 10000.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called
for its side effect of generating a plot.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the cumulative enrichment score curve
for a specified analysis unit, highlighting the dominant deviation,
enrichment direction, and contributing gene ranks.
}
\details{
An analysis unit can represent a single cell in single-cell data,
a spatial spot in spatial transcriptomics, or any other expression unit
represented by a column in the input matrix.
